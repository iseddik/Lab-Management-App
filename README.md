# Lab Management App Spring Framework


The application was developed using a range of technologies including Java, Spring Framework (Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA), Hibernate, MySQL and Thymeleaf. These tools were used to create a robust and dynamic platform designed to meet the complex requirements of research laboratory management. One of the main advantages of this project is its global approach to managing research projects, laboratory members, publications and resources. The application is aimed at a diverse set of users, from administrators to PhD students, streamlining the management, collaboration and monitoring of research activities within the laboratory. The strengths of the project are its well-organised project structure, efficient database schema and robust permissions management. By integrating Spring Security, the application guarantees secure authentication and role management, improving data integrity and user access control. The use of Thymeleaf for dynamic HTML rendering adds to the application's adaptability and ease of use. Customised dashboards based on each user's role provide quick access to essential information, making the management and monitoring of research activities more efficient and user-centric.
